# Honors Contract Instructions (Spring 2023)
- [ ] Find an Open Source Project on GitHub (1000+ stars)
  - You are highly encouraged to pick a project that you think is cool
  - You must figure out how to build and run that project from source before finalizing your project selection
    - Find the "How To Contribute To This Project" section
    - The bigger the project, (probably) the better the documentation for contributing
    - You're ideally looking for a `.devcontainer`
    - This may be the hardest part of the project, DO NOT NEGLECT THIS
  - Projects to consider (shoot for the moon):
    - https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity
    - https://github.com/torvalds/linux
    - https://github.com/chromium/chromium
    - https://github.com/python/cpython
    - https://github.com/moby/moby
  - Mirrors are fine
- [ ] Decide an Interesting Feature or Modification
  - Figure out an interesting feature or modification you want to make
  - This feature or modification should be either interesting or cool
  - This feature should take roughly 40 hours to implement all together
    - Probably this will be hard for you to accurately estimate, and that is fine
    - This will likely be difficult for you, and so even a very small feature will likely take you a very long time
    - If you finish your feature early, extend that feature further, or add another feature
- [ ] Create a Fork of that GitHub project
- [ ] Create a GitHub issue here by **Monday February 13, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
  - Title: `<user-name>/<repository-name> - <title description for feature>`
    - `<user-name>/<repository-name>` should be for the primary repository, not your fork
  - Initial Post
    - Link to the original GitHub project
    - Link to your fork
    - Describe in a few sentences the project you have selected
    - Describe in a few sentences how you built the project to get a running copy
    - Describe in a few sentences the feature or modification you are going to make
- [ ] Make Regular Commits and Write Status Updates
  - In your fork you created, make commits that move you towards implementing that feature or modification
  - In your issue you created, in a few sentences as a comment, write status updates about what you are doing
  - Status Update Timeline
    - [ ] **Monday February 27, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
    - [ ] **Monday March 13, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
    - [ ] **Monday March 27, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
    - [ ] **Monday April 10, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
    - [ ] **Monday April 24, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
  - It's not a major issue if your status updates are a little bit late, this is a rough outline
  - If you make it hard for me to quickly understand that you are doing stuff, you will not receive honors credit
- [ ] Create a YouTube video and link it in your GitHub issue by **Monday May 1, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
  - Demonstrate what the project did before you added your feature or modification
  - Show the project being built with your changes
  - Demonstrate what the project now does after you added your feature or modification
  - Describe your overall development process
  - Show your code modifications
  - Describe what you learned
  - Describe what you would do differently next time
  - Your video should be **short**, ideally ~5 minutes, it must be less than 10 minutes
  - Update the initial issue post to include a link to the YouTube video
