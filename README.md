Modify Free and Open-Source Software Projects

Everything takes place in `Issues`.

# Honors Contract Instructions (Spring 2023)
- [ ] Find an Open Source Project on GitHub (1000+ stars)
  - You are highly encouraged to pick a project that you think is cool
  - You must figure out how to build and run that project from source before finalizing your project selection
    - You're ideally looking for a `Dockerfile`, but otherwise a `Makefile`, etc.
  - Mirrors are fine
- [ ] Decide an Interesting Feature or Modification
  - Figure out an interesting feature or modification you want to make
  - This feature or modification should be either interesting or cool
  - This feature should take roughly 40 hours to implement all together
- [ ] Create a Fork of that GitHub project
- [ ] Create a GitHub issue here **by Monday February 13, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
  - Title: `<user-name>/<repository-name> - <title description for feature>`
  - Initial Post
    - Link to the original GitHub project
    - Link to your fork
    - Describe in a few sentences the project you have selected
    - Describe in a few sentences how you built the project to get a running copy
    - Describe in a few sentences the feature or modification you are going to make
- [ ] Make Regular Commits and Write Stats Updates
  - In your fork you created, make commits that move you towards implementing that feature.
  - In your issue you created, write status updates about what you are doing.
    - If you neglect this, I have no way to know that you did anything, and you will not receive honors credit
- [ ] Create a YouTube video and link it in your GitHub issue **by Monday May 1, 2023 @ 00:00:00**
  - Demonstrate what the project did before you added your feature or modification
  - Show the project being built with your changes
  - Demonstrate what the project now does after you added your feature or modification
  - Describe your overall development process
  - Show your code modifications
  - Describe what you learned
  - Describe what you would do differently next time
  - Your video should **short**, ideally ~5 minutes, it must be less than 10 minutes
  - Update the initial issue post to include a link to the YouTube video
